### Bubba's Behavior

[![Bubba RunAnim.gif](https://holocure.wiki.gg/images/thumb/b/b9/Bubba_RunAnim.gif/60px-Bubba_RunAnim.gif)](https://holocure.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Bubba_RunAnim.gif)

Bubba only appears once the player unlocks the Bubba skill for Amelia. Once unlocked, Bubba will spawn in Amelia's position and begin to run to a random point in the screen. After reaching its destination, Bubba will pick another random position within a certain radius of Amelia and will perpetually repeat this pattern. If Bubba is not visible within the viewing window, a golden arrow appears in the edge of the window pointing to where Bubba is. Leveling up Bubba seems to increase Bubba's speed.

- [x] Bubba will occasionally bark, dealing damage to a circle around him. 
- [x] Bubba can also pick up XP on the ground. The pickup radius will be similar to Amelia's pickup radius.

### Petting Bubba

Petting Bubba is a hidden mechanic not documented anywhere in the game. In order to pet Bubba, the player must position Amelia directly next to him and press and hold the P key on the keyboard. Amelia must be completely still (no movement input) otherwise the input will be ignored. Upon triggering this state, the camera will zoom in and both Amelia and Bubba will play a unique petting animation until the key is released. The player will then earn the "You Can Pet The Dog" [achievement](https://holocure.wiki.gg/wiki/Achievement "Achievement"). Neither Bubba nor Amelia will attack during this state, and Amelia will remain vulnerable to damage.
