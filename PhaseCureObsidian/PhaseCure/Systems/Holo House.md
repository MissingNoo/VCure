- [ ] Management Board
	- [ ] **Manage** - The Manage tab is where players can perform administrative options on their workers, including checking on their individuals status. Players can use this tab to feed Exhausted workers to return them to working status. This tab is also where players can rename their workers, and also fire workers, which will permanently remove them from play.
	- [ ] **Hire** - This tab allows players to recruit workers. Players must first send out a recruiting notice, which will generate a list of up to 5 random workers to choose from, but players can only choose one of the workers from the list to recruit. The first hire on this list will always be a fan of the character the player is currently using (for example, a Shrimp if the player is using Gawr Gura). Posting a recruiting notice has a starting cost of 500 HoloCoins, which increases by another 500 for each additional worker already active, up to a maximum of 5,000. Up to 10 workers can be recruited, and if players want to recruit a new worker beyond the limit, they must first fire an existing one. Each worker has 4 randomly generated main stats to consider:
		- [ ] **Efficiency** - This stat determines how fast the worker can collect HoloCoins. (1 efficiency = 1 coin gained every 2 to 10 seconds)
		- [ ] **Stamina** - The larger this stat, the longer a worker can keep working before becoming Exhausted. (1 stamina = 20 seconds of work)
		- [ ] **Max Level** - The maximum level to which the worker can be raised. Each level-up gives +1 Efficiency and +2 Stamina.
		- [ ] **EXP Rate** - How fast the worker levels up.
	- [ ] **Collect** - Players can use this tab to view the HoloCoins earned by each worker (and can be used to gauge a worker's efficiency), and here the player can collect the earned HoloCoins, which will be immediately added to the player's account.
