Ideas:
Uruka: Throws notes which can be of four different lengths (4th, quarter, half, and full). It kinda acts like a ranged version of Baelz's weapon. 
For one of it's upgrades, notes would slowly increase in size as they travel. For it's awakened form, notes would explode when touching an edge of the screen.

For skills, I don't quite know what the bone one would do, 
the trash one would allow enemies to drop spaghetti when defeated, which decrease all enemies' speeds and give Uruka extra damage. 
The brain would allow Uruka a chance to negate damage for a very small heal instead.
Her super(?), Monster, would turn her attack into a pulse that appears around her and pulses outwards, dealing high damage and knockback to enemies. 
She would also be invincible during this, and the duration would be like, 10 seconds.
